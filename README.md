# Baseball Analytics ETL & Reporting System

**Organization:** Replay Baseball Institute  
**Project Type:** Internship Projects  
**Duration:** June – August 2025  
**Tools:** SQL, Python, Looker Studio  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end baseball analytics system designed to automate player performance reporting.

I designed and optimized SQL-based ETL pipelines that integrate data from multiple player tracking technologies—including HitTrax, Blast Motion, and Rapsodo—into a unified analytics framework. The system supports automated data marts and interactive dashboards, enabling coaches and staff to make data-driven decisions efficiently.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Automate data collection and processing across multiple tracking systems  
- Build scalable SQL-based data marts for player performance analysis  
- Translate complex, multi-source datasets into actionable insights  
- Reduce manual reporting time from hours to minutes  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SQL:** Data modeling, transformations, summary tables
- **Python:** ETL automation and validation
- **Looker Studio:** Interactive dashboards and reporting
- **Analytics:** Feature engineering & applied sports analytics

## 🔄 ETL Pipeline
1. **Extract**
   - Imported raw data from HitTrax, Blast Motion, and Rapsodo systems
2. **Transform**
   - Standardized metric definitions
   - Matched player IDs and session timestamps
   - Created derived performance metrics
3. **Load**
   - Built analytics-ready summary tables (data marts)
   - Connected processed data directly to Looker Studio
